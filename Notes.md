# Digital Circuits

* Read the quesiton thoroughly
* Expected to get one guranteed quesiton on quantum circuits in the first question subsections

For exam:
* Question 1a:
  * Will generally be cuboidal
  * Normally in centimeter
  

## Question 1a
* If in the question electric field is there then the current to calculate is drift current.

### Law of Mass Action 

$n_{o}$ * $p_{o}$ = $n_{i}^{2}$
 
where:
* $n_{o}$ is the concentration of free electrons 
* $p_{o}$ is the concentration of holes
* $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration

For intrinsic silicon at room temperature:

* $n_{o}$ = $p_{o}$ ~ 1.5 x $10^{10}$ $cm^{-3}$
* $n_{i}^{2}$ ~ 2.25 x $10^{20}$
